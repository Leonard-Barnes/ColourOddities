A two-player platformer game

This game was designed by a friend and I to as a learning opportunity to explore Unity and practice with C#.
The game is design for 2 players as a co-op platformer where the two player must work together to get past obstacles
The levels get progressively harder as we learned new ways to add elements to the game
